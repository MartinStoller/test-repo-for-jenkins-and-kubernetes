UML Use Case Diagram (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zid-MVo7M-E):

Done for free with Lucidchart. Admin, bookkeeper and employee are all primary actors (-> left of the App), since they
take primary actions. There are no secondary actors (-> to the right of the App), which react to these actions.
Careful: The Database does not count as a secondary (or any) actor!

Abstract Classes and methods
    Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
    Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
    // CAREFUL: Dont set things to private, because then childclasses canÂ´t access it - set to protected instead

What is an Interface?
An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must
implement. They are similar to protocols. ... A class that implements an interface must implement all of the non-default
methods described in the interface, or be an abstract class.
